    <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> This course introduces basic elements of the design and analysis of computer
         algorithms. Topics include asymptotic notations and analysis, divide and conquer strategy, greedy methods, 
         dynamic programming, basic graph algorithms, NP-completeness, and approximation algorithms. For each topic,
          beside in-depth coverage, one or more representative problems and their algorithms shall be discussed.  </p>
    <ul>
